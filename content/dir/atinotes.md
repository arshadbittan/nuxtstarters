Atinotes is a markdown driven website, however instead of using Nuxt Content it uses nuxt hub blob storage to serve the markdown files as you would with a CMS. With this template you do not commit the markdown files like you would with Nuxt Content. This brings the advantage of not having to rebuild the site.
