Atinotes is a markdown-driven website, but instead of using Nuxt Content, it leverages Nuxt’s hub blob storage to serve markdown files, similar to a traditional CMS. Unlike Nuxt Content, this template doesn’t require you to commit markdown files directly to your repository. This offers the advantage of not needing to rebuild the site every time you update content.
